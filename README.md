This is a basic CRUD operation in VB.Net using SQLite database. I have implemented validation for FirstName, LastName, Contact Number, and Email fields. If you wish to use this project, please follow these steps:

- Download or clone the project to your desired folder.
- Update the connection string path in the form.vb file to match your project location.
- Run the project and proceed to save the data.
- The database and necessary table will be created automatically.
- After saving the data, click on the 'GetData' button in the form to populate the GridView with table data.
- You can then delete or edit data using the respective buttons.
- I am open to any feedback and suggestions.
  
Thank you.
